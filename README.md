# Meal Finder app - Vanilla JS

I built this project following along Brad Traversy's classes on Udemy. 
I hosted the app using ghpages and put the link here as well as in the description.
Check it out!

This project is the first project of projects I am committing to building over the next 100 days. For the first 30 days and possibly up to 50 days, because I do have 50+ days worth of projects to build. I am challenging myself to build one small project a day everyday for the next 50 days, taken into consideration things going on in life. 

This is part of the challenge that I am committing too alongside both #100daysofcode and #100daysoftrailhead challenges. Not only that but I am taking CS courses at the same time. Loosely I would like to adhere to the general rules of both challenges and be blogging my progress as I go along through the 100 days. It might not necessarily be on Twitter or any other platform specifically. I might even explore vlogging some of this. 

Wish me luck(:
